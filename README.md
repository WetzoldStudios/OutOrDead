# Introduction

Out Or Dead is a room-scale experience allowing for constant natural locomotion without the need to teleport or use thumb sticks.

It was available as a preview on Oculus Quest and is now superceded by [traVRsal](https://github.com/WetzoldStudios/traVRsal), which also allows to create custom world.

# Installation

The old releases are still available in the releases section. I strongly advise installing traVRsal instead though.
